# BleRDF Operation & Rules Draft

BleRDF is an easy-to-enjoy outdoor game, an adaptation of traditional ARDF (Amateur Radio Direction Finding), using Bluetooth iBeacons for a "treasure hunt" style experience.

## 1. Required Equipment

| Role | Equipment | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Player | 1. Receiver | Use a dedicated receiver or a smartphone with a BLE scanning app. |
| | 2. Record Card | For recording proof of discovery (stamps or stickers). Not required if using QR codes for recording. |
| Organizer | 1. Beacons | At least 3-5. Ensure they are powered on. |
| | 2. Recording Tools | Stamps/stickers, or QR code placements for recording. |
| | 3. Area Map | A simple map showing the search area. Mark the start position and boundaries. |

## 2. Preparation and Setup (for Organizers)

### A. Area Selection and Rule Setting

1. **Select a Safe Area**
   - Choose a safe area for movement, such as a park, a private forest, or a large open field.
   - Avoid dangerous places (cliffs, unauthorized private property, bodies of water, areas near heavy traffic).
2. **Define the Search Area**
   - Draw clear boundaries on the area map and communicate them to the players.
3. **Determine the Winning Conditions**
   - If necessary, set a target number of discoveries, such as "find all beacons" or "find 3 or more beacons."

### B. Beacon and Recording Point Placement

- **Simple Hiding Spots**
  - Place the beacons where players can easily reach them by hand.
- **Set up Recording Points**
  - Near each beacon, place a stamp, sticker, or a QR code for digital recording.
  - Clearly mark each recording point with a **unique identifier** (e.g., an alphabet letter or an animal picture) that corresponds to the discovered beacon.
- **Test Placed Beacons**
  - Test the signal strength (RSSI) of the beacons at the venue beforehand to determine the approximate distance at which a player is considered "close."
  - For battery-powered beacons, check if the voltage is adequate and if they can broadcast a stable signal for the duration of the event.

## 3. How to Play

### 1. Start

- Receive a record card from the organizer if needed.
- Start your receiver or launch a BLE scanner app like LightBlue on your smartphone and begin scanning.

### 2. Direction Finding

- **Using Signal Strength (RSSI)**
  - Target the strongest signal (the one with the smallest absolute number).
- **Estimating Direction**
  - Proceed in the direction where the signal gets stronger (the RSSI value decreases).
  - BLE uses a 2.4GHz radio frequency, and signals can be reflected or blocked by buildings and terrain. It's important to carefully observe signal changes to estimate the direction.
- **Shielding Technique**
  - BLE signals are weak and easily blocked by the body or obstacles. A useful technique is to place your body between the receiver and the suspected beacon location. If the signal weakens, the beacon is likely in the opposite direction.

### 3. Discovery and Recording

- **Physical Search**
  - When the signal strength reaches a certain threshold (e.g., below -50dBm), start a physical search of the immediate surroundings.
  - This threshold is just a guideline. It can vary depending on the receiver and the environment, so prioritize the results of on-site testing.
- **Record Your Find**
  - Once you find the hidden beacon, use the provided stamp, sticker, or QR code to record your discovery.

### 4. Goal

- **Finish**
  - Once you meet the set winning conditions (e.g., collecting records for 3 beacons), return to the starting point promptly to finish.
- **Verification**
  - Have your record card checked by the organizer.

## 4. Rule Setting and Enjoyment

### For a Pure Treasure Hunt

- The goal is to find all the beacons within the time limit.
- Enjoy the act of finding itself without ranking. Finding even one beacon is a success, making it enjoyable for beginners.

### For a Competition

- The winner is the player who finds the set number of beacons in the shortest time with no recording errors.
- Players may be disqualified for recording incorrect proof or for dangerous behavior.

## 5. Safety Precautions

- **Principle of Self-Responsibility**
  - Participants are responsible for their own injuries or accidents during the event. Please ensure you have insurance and are in good health.
- **Consideration for Others**
  - In areas with the general public, do not run and be careful not to obstruct other people or vehicles.
  - Be mindful not to damage natural features like bushes and trees.
- **Emergency Contact Information**
  - Have a system in place for immediate contact in case of an emergency.
