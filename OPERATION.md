# BleRDF Operation and Rule Proposal

BleRDF is an easy-to-enjoy outdoor game that arranges traditional ARDF (Amateur Radio Direction Finding) as a "treasure hunt" using Bluetooth iBeacons.

## 1. Required Equipment

| Role | Equipment | Remarks |  
|---|---|---|
| Player | 1. Receiver | Use a dedicated receiver or a smartphone with a BLE scanning app installed. |  
| | 2. Record Card | For recording proof of discovery (stamps or stickers). Not required if recording with a QR code. |  
| Organizer | 1. Beacons | At least 3 to 5 beacons. Make sure they are powered on. |  
| | 2. Recording Tools | Stamps/stickers, or a QR code for recording. |
| | 3. Area Map | A simple map showing the search area. The start position and range should be indicated. |  

## 2. Preparation and Setup (for Organizers)

### A. Area Selection and Rule Setting

1. Selection of a Safe Area
 * Set a range where players can move safely, such as a park, a forest on the premises, or a public square.
 * Avoid dangerous places (cliffs, private property without permission, bodies of water, areas with heavy traffic).  
2. Specification of the Search Area
 * Draw a clear boundary line on the area map and communicate it to the players.  
3. Determination of Clearing Conditions
 * If necessary, set a target number of discoveries, such as "find all beacons" or "find 3 or more beacons."

### B. Beacon and Record Point Setup

1. Simple Hiding Places
 * Install the beacon itself within a range where players can easily touch it.  
2. Setting up Record Points
 * Install a stamp, sticker, or a QR code for digital recording right next to the beacon.  
 * Clearly indicate a **unique mark** (e.g., an alphabet letter or an animal picture) at the record point that matches the discovered beacon.  
3. Test the Installed Beacons
 * Test the signal strength (RSSI) of the beacons at the venue in advance to determine at what distance it can be judged that a player is "close."  
 * If the beacons are battery-powered, check if the voltage is appropriate and if they can transmit a stable signal during the competition time.

## 3. How to Play

### 1. Start

* Receive a record card from the organizer if necessary.
* Launch LightBlue on your receiver or smartphone and start scanning.

### 2. Direction Finding

* Using Signal Strength (RSSI)
 * Target the strongest signal (the one with the smallest absolute number).
* Guessing the Direction
 * Proceed while guessing the direction in which the signal becomes stronger (the direction in which the RSSI value becomes smaller).
* Shielding Technique
 * BLE radio waves are weak and are easily blocked by the body or obstacles. A useful technique is to place your body between your smartphone and the beacon to block the signal, and then judge that the approximate direction of the beacon is the opposite of the direction in which the signal becomes weaker.

**Points**
BLE (iBeacon) is a radio wave, and signals can be reflected or blocked by buildings and terrain.
It is important to carefully guess the direction while closely observing the changes in the signal.


### 3. Discovery and Recording

* When the signal strength reaches a certain standard (e.g., -50dBm or less), physically search the surroundings. 
  * Note: This standard value is just a guideline. It varies depending on the app and the model, so prioritize the results of on-site tests.
* When you find the hidden beacon, leave evidence using the stamp, sticker, or QR code at that location.

### 4. Goal

* When you have met the set clearing conditions (e.g., collected all the records for 3 beacons), return to the starting point promptly and finish.
* Have your record card checked by the organizer.


## 4. Scoring and How to Enjoy

### To Enjoy as a Pure Treasure Hunt

* The goal is to find all the beacons within the time limit.
* Enjoy the "act of finding" without ranking. Even finding one is considered a success, making it enjoyable for beginners.

### To Enjoy as a Competition

* The winner is the player who finds the set number of beacons in the shortest time and has no errors in their records.
* Players will be disqualified for recording incorrect evidence or for dangerous behavior.


## 5. Safety Precautions

* Principle of Self-Responsibility
 * Participants are responsible for any injuries or accidents during the competition. Please ensure you have insurance and are in good health.
* Consideration for the Surroundings
 * In areas with other people, do not run and be careful not to obstruct the passage of other users or vehicles.
 * Be careful not to damage natural objects such as plantings and trees.
* Emergency Contact Information 
 * Make the organizer's contact information known and have a system in place for immediate contact in case of an emergency.
